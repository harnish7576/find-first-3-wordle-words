# Predicting words for the New York Times Wordle Game

The project is to write a program cost function, and a program to search for it. The program will then take the list of Wordle Words, and find three good starting words. The goal is to have the first three words (five letters each) test 15 different letters.

In your write-up, describe your cost function. Your program should load all of the words, then pick a word that best fits that cost function.

Once that first word has been selected, your program should winnow down the choices for other words. Then pick a second word, again based on some kind of cost function that you designed.

The selection of a second word will further reduce the set of possible words to use which do not
conflict. Then you pick a third word.
